## 🕯️ Debugging Grimoire: The Tome of Cursed Knowledge

This is my personal collection of **hard-earned debugging wisdom**, gathered from countless nights battling **rogue services, broken deployments, and cursed error messages.** The goal is simple: **never struggle with the same problem twice.**

Rather than leaving my notes scattered across **random bookmarks, Discord servers, and Google Docs**, this grimoire serves as a **single source of truth** for all things **database, Linux, and DevOps.** More sections might be added over time—especially for **programming languages and specific frameworks.**

If you're reading this, you're either **past-me, future-me, or an unfortunate soul who has stumbled upon my secret knowledge.** Either way, remember:

- 🛠️ Debugging is an art, not a science.

- 💀 Nothing works until it does.

- ✅ The green checkmark is the ultimate goal.

Welcome to the **Grimoire of Debugging Madness.** May it save me (and possibly others) from unnecessary suffering.
